Based on the ImageEnhander concept used by BBC news outlined in .net magazine.

- Images on the page will be wrapped in `div`s with a class of `delayed-image` on them. 
- Into these, we load a 1x1 pixel image (perhaps using base64 encoded strings)
- Set the `width` and `height` of the images in these containers to the necessary size. The size needed is set either by the server side or tooling via `data-attr` specified on the `div`.
- Set the class of each image to `image-replaced`
- Use `setTimeout` with a 250-300ms duration to unblock the UI thread and call a `resizeImage` function which enhanes the `image-replaced` images as necessary
- Perhaps have an event listener for the resize event which will fire `imager:resize`
- `resizeImage` is called on page load and each time the `imager:resize` event is fired. It loops through `image-replaced`, changing the `src` attribute to a project hosted image URL with the dimensions required for the image. The resize event will check the dimensions of the page to determine if a new URL is to be served.

Actual implementation:

- Use grunt-responsive-images for image generation based on a source directory of them
- Use Imager.js (to be implemented) for the runtime handling of image hot-swapping
